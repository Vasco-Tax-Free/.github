## Platform principles

- **API-first & headless:** the UI is yours; the rails are ours  
- **Deterministic workflows:** clear states, idempotency, safe retries  
- **Security by default:** least privilege, defense-in-depth, auditable changes  
- **Operational excellence:** metrics, tracing, SLOs, and incident readiness  
- **Composable integrations:** modular adapters, versioned contracts, minimal lock-in

## Security & compliance

We operate in regulated workflows where trust must be provable:
- End-to-end traceability and audit-friendly records
- Strong data protection, access controls, and compliance-by-design
